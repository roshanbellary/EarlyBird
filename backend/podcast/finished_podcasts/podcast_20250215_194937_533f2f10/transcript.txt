<HOST>Dr. Bellary, it's great to have you on the show today. With these new tariffs, what do you think is the biggest concern for businesses operating within these affected sectors? And how might these tariffs impact the broader economy?</HOST>

<EXPERT>The biggest concern for businesses is the potential disruption to their supply chains, leading to increased costs and potentially lower profit margins. These tariffs could also impact consumer spending due to price increases, potentially leading to a broader economic slowdown.</EXPERT>

<HOST>What specific industries do you think will be most affected by these tariffs, Dr. Bellary, and why? And how might this impact the U.S. workforce in those sectors?</HOST>

<EXPERT>The automotive and manufacturing sectors will be significantly impacted due to their heavy reliance on cross-border trade with these countries. The workforce in these sectors may face layoffs or reduced hours as companies adjust to increased costs and potential supply chain disruptions.</EXPERT>

<HOST>Dr. Bellary, how can businesses in these affected sectors mitigate these potential impacts on their workforce and operations? And what role do you see for government support in this situation?</HOST>

<EXPERT>Businesses can mitigate impacts by diversifying their supply chains, investing in local production, and exploring alternative sources for raw materials. Government support is crucial in providing incentives for such efforts and enabling the workforce to adapt through retraining programs and other job creation initiatives.</EXPERT>

<HOST>Dr. Bellary, can you provide some examples of successful diversification strategies in response to trade disruptions? And how might government policies contribute to fostering such strategies?</HOST>

<EXPERT>Companies can diversify supply chains by exploring regional alternatives, partnering with local suppliers, and investing in resilient logistics networks. Governments can support these efforts through tax incentives, infrastructure development, and skill development programs. For instance, Germany's "Made in Germany" initiative encourages businesses to invest in domestic production, while countries like Brazil and India have focused on developing their own technology industries to reduce reliance on imports.</EXPERT>
