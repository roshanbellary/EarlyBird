The government has asked a judge for permission to put the case on hold.Credit...Dave Sanders for The New York TimesBy Benjamin Weiser,\u00a0William K. Rashbaum and Jonah E. BromwichFeb. 14, 2025Updated 8:58 p.m. ETThe first act of a drama that has shaken the Department of Justice ended Friday when a top official signed a formal request to drop corruption charges against New York\u2019s mayor after Manhattan\u2019s acting U.S. attorney refused to and resigned.The official, Emil Bove III, had originally ordered Manhattan federal prosecutors who brought the case against Mayor Eric Adams to seek its dismissal. But the leader of the Manhattan office, Danielle R. Sassoon, resigned rather than obey, and she was followed out the door by at least six other prosecutors in New York and Washington.Mr. Bove, whose order specified that the decision to dismiss the case had nothing do with its legal strengths, was ultimately compelled to sign the motion himself, along with two other Washington prosecutors, Edward Sullivan and Antoinette T. Bacon.The reason he gave the judge was the same as he gave the New York prosecutors: that the prosecution would hinder Mr. Adams\u2019s ability to cooperate with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. It was a highly unusual rationale for dismissing a criminal case, which is typically evaluated on the basis of the facts and the law. The abnormality was underscored by Mr. Bove\u2019s difficulty in finding a prosecutor willing to affix a name to the filing.Now attention will turn to Dale E. Ho, the judge who is overseeing the case in Manhattan federal court.Mr. Adams was indicted last year on five counts, including bribery, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. He pleaded not guilty and was scheduled for trial in April. Ms. Sassoon, in a letter to the attorney general this week, said that prosecutors were prepared to bring an additional charge that would accuse him of destroying evidence and instructing others to do the same.A lawyer for Mr. Adams, Alex Spiro, called that a false claim. He said that if prosecutors had proof that the mayor destroyed evidence \u201cthey would have brought those charges \u2014 as they continually threatened to do.\u201dUnder the law, judges may question a prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek a dismissal of charges, but they almost always grant such requests. Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University School of Law, said that Judge Ho could decide that the Adams case was the rare exception, that the government\u2019s justification was inadequate.Ordinarily it is the responsibility of the U.S. attorney whose office prosecutes a case to move for its dismissal. But Ms. Sassoon, 38, quit Thursday after telling the attorney general that she would not obey an order that had no valid basis.In her letter to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, Ms. Sassoon characterized the order as a quid pro quo \u2014 dropping the charges in exchange for the mayor\u2019s support of Mr. Trump\u2019s political program.\u201cI cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations,\u201d Ms. Sassoon wrote.The Manhattan federal prosecutors who had been involved in Mr. Adams\u2019s case sent a letter to Judge Ho on Friday evening indicating they were withdrawing.They included Hagan Scotten, the lead prosecutor, who had already resigned from the Southern District in protest of Mr. Bove\u2019s order.In a scathing resignation letter, Mr. Scotten wrote that any federal prosecutor \u201cwould know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf no lawyer within earshot of the president is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.\u201dThree others also left the case: Celia V. Cohen, Andrew Rohrbach and Derek Wikstrom.In his directive to Ms. Sassoon, Mr. Bove said that he had told the mayor\u2019s lawyers that the government was not offering \u201cto exchange dismissal of a criminal case for Adams\u2019s assistance on immigration enforcement.\u201d But on Thursday, hours after Ms. Sassoon quit, the mayor said he would allow federal immigration authorities to operate within the Rikers Island jail complex.ImageManhattan prosecutors had waited for days to see how Danielle R. Sassoon would handle the Justice Department\u2019s request.Credit...Kent Nishimura for The New York TimesMs. Sassoon said in court papers last month that there was \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of crimes by Mr. Adams, and that his claims that his prosecution was politically motivated were meant to divert attention \u201cfrom the evidence of his guilt.\u201dFor days, Manhattan prosecutors had been watching to see how Ms. Sassoon would handle the Justice Department\u2019s directive to drop the charges; she and other top prosecutors had traveled to Washington recently to meet with department officials to discuss the issue in person.The Trump administration last month elevated Ms. Sassoon, a veteran prosecutor, to head the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York while President Trump\u2019s choice for the post, Jay Clayton, awaited Senate confirmation.In Mr. Bove\u2019s letter accepting her resignation, he blasted her handling of the case and decision to disobey his order.He told her that the prosecutors who had worked on the case against Mr. Adams were being placed on administrative leave too, and said they and Ms. Sassoon would be investigated by the attorney general and the Justice Department\u2019s internal investigative arm.Matthew Podolsky, who had been Ms. Sassoon\u2019s deputy, is now the acting U.S. attorney.The indictment against Mr. Adams was announced in September by the U.S. attorney who led the office during the Biden administration, Damian Williams. Mr. Adams, a Democrat, has claimed that he was targeted because of his criticism of the administration over the migrant crisis \u2014 an assertion the Southern District has rebutted, noting that the investigation began well before the mayor made those comments.Mr. Adams has praised parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, visited him near his Mar-a-Lago compound and attended his inauguration a few days later. Mr. Trump had floated the possibility of a pardon, and criticized Mr. Adams\u2019s prosecution, saying the mayor had been \u201ctreated pretty unfairly.\u201dBenjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.

Jackson said in 1940 while serving as attorney general.Credit...Oscar White/Corbis, via Getty ImagesBy Adam LiptakReporting from WashingtonFeb. 14, 2025, 1:55 p.m. ETSpeaking to U.S. attorneys in 1940, Attorney General Robert H. Jackson reflected on the enormous scope of prosecutorial power and the crucial importance of shielding it from politics.\u201cThe prosecutor has more control over life, liberty and reputation than any other person in America,\u201d Mr. Jackson, who would go on to be a Supreme Court justice of rare distinction, wrote in a text that is taught to law students and circulated to young lawyers.Sharply differing interpretations of the classic 85-year-old speech, \u201cThe Federal Prosecutor,\u201d figured prominently in an extraordinary exchange of letters on Thursday that led to the resignation of Danielle R. Sassoon after she refused to carry out the Trump administration\u2019s command to drop the corruption prosecution of New York City\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams.The two views reflect a schism in conservative legal thought over how prosecutors, now working for a Trump-led Justice Department, should balance their duty to obey orders from superiors with their obligation to follow their best understanding of the law. One view emphasizes caution, deliberation, and independent and decentralized judgment, while the other values top-down vigor in the service of policy goals that can seem transactional if not unprincipled.The split could reshape not only the relationship between federal prosecutors around the country and their bosses in Washington, but also the limited but real discretion enjoyed by all sorts of other officials throughout the government. Thursday\u2019s events, in other words, are emblematic of the ethos of the second Trump administration, one that requires federal workers to fall into line or be fired.Ms. Sassoon, whose resignation led to a cascade of others, cited Mr. Jackson\u2019s speech to argue that the administration\u2019s directive was not the product of a good-faith difference of opinion but an assault on the rule of law.She wrote that she could not ethically ask a judge to dismiss a case when she did not believe the law supported the move and quoted Mr. Jackson: \u201cThe prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society; when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.\u201dEditors\u2019 PicksHow to Create the Perfect BunWhy Doesn\u2019t My Son\u2019s Adviser Understand That Boys Will Be Boys?For These 20-Somethings, Trump \u2018Is Making It Sexy\u2019 to Be RepublicanAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageDanielle Sassoon cited Mr. Jackson\u2019s speech in her decision not to carry out the Trump administration\u2019s command to drop the corruption prosecution of New York City\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams.Credit...Kent Nishimura for The New York TimesEmil Bove III, who represented President Trump in three criminal cases and now serves as acting deputy attorney general, responded in accepting Ms. Sassoon\u2019s resignation that federal prosecutors, like other members of the executive branch, are tasked with advancing the president\u2019s goals. The case against Mr. Adams, Mr. Bove wrote, interfered with the mayor\u2019s ability to address two of the administration\u2019s key priorities, immigration and violent crime.\u201cYou lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice by suggesting that you retain discretion to interpret the Constitution in a manner inconsistent with the policies of a democratically elected president,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Jackson was 48 and just three months into his tenure as attorney general when he gave his speech, which is universally acknowledged to be the classic account of the prosecutor\u2019s role. He had earlier served as solicitor general, the federal government\u2019s top appellate lawyer, and he would go on, in addition to sitting on the Supreme Court, to be a prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials after World War II.A central point of his speech was that U.S. attorneys, the top federal law enforcement officials in the nation\u2019s 94 judicial districts, should generally have the last word. Local prosecutors know the facts on the ground, the judges they appear before, the jury pool and \u201clocal sentiment and opinion,\u201d Mr. Jackson wrote.\u201cIt is an unusual case,\u201d Mr. Jackson wrote, \u201cin which his judgment should be overruled.\u201dMs. Sassoon wrote that the decision to dismiss the charges against Mr. Adams over her objections was not the product of the sort of sober deliberation that should warrant an exception to that general approach. She said Mr. Adams\u2019s lawyers had urged what she characterized as a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in which the mayor would support Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities if the indictment were dismissed.\u201cI remain baffled,\u201d she wrote, \u201cby the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams\u2019s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal.\u201dMs. Sassoon\u2019s interpretation of Mr. Jackson\u2019s words is the conventional one, and it is a reflection of her credentials and place in the conservative legal community.

Barrett, a law professor at St. John\u2019s University who is writing a biography of Justice Jackson, said there was little doubt about how he would have viewed the Justice Department\u2019s handling of the Adams case. \u201cPretty obviously he would be dismayed and appalled,\u201d Professor Barrett said.ImageEmil Bove III, the acting deputy attorney general, seemed to ignore the main theme of the speech and quoted snippets from it in his response to Ms. Sassoon.Credit...Pool photo by Angela WeissMr. Bove, however, drew a different lesson from the Jackson speech in his letter accepting Ms. Sassoon\u2019s resignation, writing that there was \u201cgreat irony\u201d in Ms. Sassoon\u2019s invocation of the speech.\u201cHis remarks are unquestionably relevant here, but not in the way you have suggested,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Bove, seeming to ignore the main theme of the speech, quoted snippets from it.\u201cJackson warned that \u2018some measure of centralized control\u2019 over federal prosecutors was \u2018necessary,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\u201cThe senior leadership of the Justice Department exercises that control,\u201d Mr. Bove went on. \u201cMoreover, one of Jackson\u2019s concerns was that \u2018the most dangerous power of the prosecutor\u2019 arises from the risk that the prosecutor would \u2018pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted.\u2019\u201dJudge Wilkinson, who was among the judges President George W. Bush considered naming to the Supreme Court, said on Friday that Ms. Sassoon had been an exemplary law clerk.\u201cWhile I do not know the particulars in this case,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat I do know is that Danielle possesses great integrity and courage, which has always made me proud.\u201dIn a tribute after Justice Scalia died in 2016, Ms. Sassoon wrote that his loyalty was to neutral legal principles.\u201cJustice Scalia was devoted to the integrity of reasoning and ideas,\u201d Ms. Sassoon wrote. \u201cHe cared deeply about logic, process and the rules that undergirded particular outcomes \u2014 those rules would endure and be the tools used by lower courts to decide future cases.\u201dImageA law professor said Mr. Jackson \u201cwould be dismayed and appalled\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s handling of Mr. Adams\u2019s case.Credit...Dave Sanders for The New York TimesMs. Sassoon added, in a passage that seemed to anticipate her resignation, that Justice Scalia \u201clacked the abundant caution that plagues today\u2019s media-conscious politicians, judges and lawyers.\u201dIn instructing Ms. Sassoon on Monday to dismiss the charges against Mr. Adams, Mr. Bove invoked a different set of values, one rooted in politics and payback.\u201cIt cannot be ignored that Mayor Adams criticized the prior administration\u2019s immigration policies before the charges were filed,\u201d Mr. Bove wrote.In a footnote, Mr. Bove denied offering an explicit deal to Mr. Adams\u2019s lawyer, writing that he said at a meeting last month that \u201cthe government is not offering to exchange dismissal of a criminal case for Adams\u2019s assistance on immigration enforcement.\u201dThe footnote should be read as a warning sign, Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, wrote in a newsletter on Thursday. \u201cThe need to put in writing that dropping the prosecution was not in exchange for \u2018assistance on immigration enforcement,\u2019\u201d he wrote, \u201csure seemed to strongly imply that actually \u2026 it was.\u201dImageMr. Jackson taking his oath as attorney general in the Oval Office with President Franklin D.

Maybe Not for Adams.Judge Dale E. Ho will weigh the request after the resignation of Manhattan\u2019s U.S. attorney and her accusations of misconduct.Share full articleCredit...Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersBy Benjamin Weiser and Jonah E. BromwichFeb. 14, 2025Updated 9:30 p.m. ETFederal judges have almost no ability under the law to refuse a government request to drop criminal charges. The corruption case against Mayor Eric Adams of New York may be the exception.On Thursday, Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Danielle R. Sassoon, resigned rather than obey an order to seek dismissal of the charges against the mayor. The directive was issued by Emil Bove III, the acting No. 2 official in President Trump\u2019s Justice Department and his former criminal lawyer.Mr. Bove wrote that the demand had nothing to do with the strength of the evidence against the mayor or legal theories in the case. Rather, he said the charges would interfere with Mr. Adams\u2019s ability \u201cto devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies\u201d of the Biden administration.After Ms. Sassoon\u2019s resignation as head of the Southern District of New York and those of at least seven Justice Department officials, Mr. Bove himself signed a motion on Friday asking the judge to dismiss the case.It remains to be seen how the judge, Dale E. Ho of Federal District Court in Manhattan, will respond.\u201cJudge Ho could say this is a politically motivated decision and it affronts the grand jury process and the integrity of the court,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University School of Law.Professor Gillers said Judge Ho could decide that the government\u2019s justification for seeking dismissal was inadequate. The government would almost certainly appeal, he said.Since Mr. Adams was indicted in September, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York has vigorously prosecuted the charges against the mayor in court, continuing to do so after the Trump administration elevated Ms. Sassoon last month to lead the office. Judge Ho has repeatedly denied Mr. Adams\u2019s requests to have the case dismissed.Ms. Sassoon, in a letter Thursday to the attorney general, noted that Judge Ho had \u201cstressed transparency\u201d during the case. She said the judge was likely to conduct a rigorous and lengthy court inquiry that could be \u201cdetrimental to the department\u2019s reputation, regardless of outcome.\u201dIn her letter, Ms. Sassoon said that Mr. Bove\u2019s suggestion that the issue was merely removing an obstacle to the mayor\u2019s ability to help with federal immigration enforcement did not bear scrutiny.\u201cRather than be rewarded,\u201d Ms. Sassoon said, \u201cAdams\u2019s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.\u201dProfessor Gillers said Mr. Bove\u2019s rationale for seeking dismissal of the charges would not sit well with the judge.\u201cJudge Ho will not accept that \u2014 should not accept that \u2014 as the justification for throwing out a grand jury decision to indict.\u201dJudge Ho, a graduate of Yale Law School, has been on the bench only a short time: He was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and narrowly confirmed by the Senate in 2023. But few judges of any tenure have faced a situation like the one he confronts now.In the past, even judges who have expressed reservations about a government request to drop charges felt compelled to go along, given their limited say.The issue arose in 2020 during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, in the prosecution of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser. That year, Mr. Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., sought to withdraw his plea, and federal prosecutors in Washington moved to dismiss the indictment against him. When the judge overseeing the case, Emmet G. Sullivan, did not immediately grant the dismissal, Mr. Flynn took his argument to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.In a June 2020 decision, a three-judge panel of that court noted that \u201cdecisions to dismiss pending criminal charges\u201d were squarely within a prosecutor\u2019s purview and that circumstances in which a judge could intervene were limited. That precedent stands. In a more recent case, federal prosecutors in Washington last month moved to dismiss an indictment against two men associated with the Proud Boys. They received clemency from Mr. Trump after pleading guilty in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.The judge, Beryl A. Howell, wrote a scathing opinion criticizing the government\u2019s rationale for asking to drop the charges \u2014 that Mr. Trump\u2019s pardons and commutations for Jan. 6 offenses had ended \u201ca grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people.\u201d\u201cThis court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,\u201d Judge Howell wrote, noting that the defendants had admitted to their conduct and had been afforded every protection guaranteed by the Constitution.But Judge Howell said there were no \u201clegitimate grounds\u201d to deny the government\u2019s motion, and she granted the request to dismiss the indictment.Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.
